# Investor Memo - WASTECONNECTIONS

**Company:** Anticloud FZ LLE
**Model:** PAX L5 Narrow L2 General 27B
**Project:** WASTECONNECTIONS | Category: WASTE_MANAGEMENT
**Upstream:** https://github.com/nicedoc/wasteconnections (MIT)

## 1. Opportunity

Regulated operators need Waste routing and scheduling optimizer without data egress. Cloud-hosted alternatives leak data by architecture; Anticloud FZ LLE delivers WASTECONNECTIONS as an offline-first package with PAX L5 Narrow L2 General 27B inference on-device.

## 2. Product

WASTECONNECTIONS (https://github.com/nicedoc/wasteconnections, MIT) integrated with: local PAX L5 Narrow L2 General 27B inference (4-bit, single T4, offline), AIOSS ledger on every mutation (SHA3-256, device-local Ed25519 keys), AES-256-GCM at rest, single-binary installer. See 10_TECHNICAL_HANDOFF and 28_TECHNICAL_WHITEPAPER for architecture.

## 3. Market & Go-To-Market

Category WASTE_MANAGEMENT; regulated verticals first (healthcare, defense, finance, government). Direct pilots + white-label partners. Pricing: per-project enterprise license (see 07_ENTERPRISE_LICENSE_AND_PRICING).

## 4. Benchmarks & Verification

Kaggle v52: 4.1-4.2 tok/s single T4, 20/20 coherent, chain head 2828cffabd1d063a. Suite: MITRE ATT&CK 100/100, NIST AI RMF 88%, TRL 7/9, ISO 27001 83%, EU AI Act 77.4%. Evidence in OFFICIAL_BENCHMARKS with AIOSS chain continuity. Lab results in ISOLATED_LAB_RESULTS where applicable.

## 5. Team

Lois-Kleinner Alpasan (Founder, CEO & CTO) — sole builder of the 862-project corpus, PAX pipeline, AIOSS ledger, and KANTOR K5 hash. Hiring plan in INVESTOR_PACKAGE.

## 6. Risks & Mitigations

- Upstream drift: mitigated by vendored offline mirror + SHA3-256 pinning (27_DEPENDENCIES).
- Single-founder execution: mitigated by deterministic harness (every deliverable regenerable from scripts).
- Regulatory change: compliance mappings versioned per release.

## 7. Terms

Non-dilutive preferred, initialization round. Private enquiries only, accredited/institutional.
