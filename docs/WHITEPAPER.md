# Technical Whitepaper — WASTECONNECTIONS

**Model:** PAX L5 Narrow L2 General 27B
**Company:** Anticloud FZ LLE
**Upstream:** https://github.com/nicedoc/wasteconnections
**Category:** WASTE_MANAGEMENT

## Abstract

This whitepaper describes the Anticloud integration of `WASTECONNECTIONS` (Waste routing and scheduling optimizer)
with PAX L5 Narrow L2 General 27B, the offline-first AI model developed by Anticloud FZ LLE.
The integration produces a zero-cloud, single-binary deployment that exceeds upstream
capabilities while eliminating all third-party API dependencies.

## Technical Improvements

1. PAX L5 Narrow L2 General 27B local waste classification from images — edge deployment
2. AIOSS tamper-evident waste tracking chain (EPA manifest audit-ready)
3. AES-256 encryption for all collection route and manifest data
4. Single-binary fleet management system deployable on vehicle tablets
5. Zero-cloud: all AI sorting, routing, and reporting runs locally
6. GPU/CPU equalizer: vision classification on embedded GPU or CPU
7. Open EPA e-Manifest integration replacing proprietary waste tracking software
8. Offline circular economy optimization: material recovery routing without internet
